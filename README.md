# train-scheduler

This scheduler is meant to showcase firebase useage, as well as momentJS. It was a fairly straightforward project, but the momentJS did give me some trouble. Ultimately, I was able to find a syntax bug that was causing my timeing to be displayed incorrectly. 

The styling is a little less fabulous than some of my other projects, but I decided to design for readablity rather than fabulosity for this particular project.
